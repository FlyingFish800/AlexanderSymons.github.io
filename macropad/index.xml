      <description>While writing the macropad firmware in CircuitPython I ran into some of its limitations, especially in regards to speed and IO. While trying to find solutions I discovered that there was another embedded python project: MicroPython. A basic display test showed that MicroPython was significantly faster than CircuitPython when driving the I2C OLED on the macropad, as well as handling the logic when a key is released. The only problem with MicroPython was that it didn&amp;rsquo;t have a USB HID library to implement the core functionality of the macropad.</description>

After working on the firmware for a while, I have got the macropad to work! Progress was pretty quick getting the lighting to work on the board. I had all the neopixels responding to keypresses according to the kdl config file after less than a week of work, and it was really motivating to see the description language I hacked together actually work surprisingly well.</description>

Three or four months ago, my friend (Varun Sreedharan) approached me about writing firmware for a macropad he had created. It uses a custom PCB, a Raspberry Pi PICO, low profile switches, an oled I2C display, and a few 3D printed parts to create a surprisingly satisfying to use piece of hardware.
I started by writing a parser for a language I named Keyboard Description Language, or KDL.</description>
