<p>After working on the firmware for a while, I have got the macropad to work! Progress was pretty quick getting the lighting to work on the board. I had all the neopixels responding to keypresses according to the kdl config file after less than a week of work, and it was really motivating to see the description language I hacked together actually work suprisingly well.</p>
<p>Afterwards I moved on to the most integral part of any macropad: the OLED display. I was quickly able to get text working on this display as Adafruit&rsquo;s ssd1306 library provides a very straight-forward function to print text. I wanted to add a way of rendering full images, which led me to look through the source code of all the framebuffer and ssd1306 drivers to create a simple pbm codec that could write to the framebuffer.</p>
<p>From the basic event handler I used when testing on my laptop, it took a little but of reworking KDL to implement more complex key events for all the features the board had that I couldn&rsquo;t really test on my numpad, such as a display and neopixels. I settled on a sturcture where the key pressed and released methods of the &lsquo;interpreter&rsquo; returns lists for all the actions organized by their type. Currently they return a tuple structured as follows:<br>
<code>(changed_state, led_update, display_command, press_sequence, type_str, errors)</code><br>
This allows KDL to be very portable, as the project using it need only to implement the set list of commands that the interpreter can return for a key event.</p>
<p>Press_sequence and type_str commands were seperated to differentiate between two distinct forms of key pressing: Shortcuts and typing. Type_str types each stign of characyers one by one as you would expect, but press_sequence holds each key until the very last one is typed. This subtle distinction makes it possible to do shortcuts like <code>CTRL ALT t</code> to open a bash terminal in Ubuntu, which has been particulartly helpful for me.</p>
<p>I had gotten to this point after several weeks of working on the firmware and starting a new quarter at college, and progress was going well. I just needed to implement the usb keyboard functionality, and it would be mostly complete. Instead, I started to notice the limitations of CircuitPython. Only a few debug pritn statements would slow down the code noticably, and I2C communication with the display was even more egregious, holding up the <strong>one</strong> core that CicruitPython would let me use. After a basic test of the SSD1306 in MicroPython made CircuitPython look ebarrasingly slow, I knew I wanted to switch. The only problem was that MicroPython doesn&rsquo;t have a USB HID library, so I would have to figure out how to write my own using C and either compile it into an mpy module, or compile it into MicroPython itself. I spent about 3 months working on this problem, which I will probably talk more about in <a href="/macropad/micropython_macropad">another post</a>, but it ended up not working out. I really want to revisit this tangent later, as I think if I took some time to familiarize myself with the TinyUSB library I used it would work.</p>
<p>In the end, I came back to the CircuitPython based firmware, and finished implementing the keyboard functionality. This is where I am now. The firmware currenlty works, and I am now working on polishing it. The CircuitPython speed problems aren&rsquo;t really an issue, the macropad feels suprisingly snappy, but it still bugs me to have so much performance still on the table.</p>
