    <p>From my highschool&rsquo;s maker club I got an old ATI Radeon HD3450 GPU from broken school computers that were being salvaged for their power supplies. I wanted to learn how the graphics card worked electrically, and try modifying it to understand the power delivery circuity worked. Sadly I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to try modifying the circuit the time because this HD3450 only has an S-Video port and a DMS-59 port to output video, neither of which I have a cable for. Looking into the DMS-59 standard I found that it was a way for companies to include 2 VGA ports in one smaller port for small GPUs, and that electronically it had two VGA cables inside it. I thought this would a perfect oppertunity for me to learn how to design a PCB, so I could get this card working and experiment with it.</p>
<p>My friend Varun reccomended EasyEDA for PCB development because of its ease of use and integration with JLC PCB and LCSC, so I used it to start working on my board. It ended up being a really simple design, as I essentially just made a break out board that I could mount on the hole previously used for the GPU&rsquo;s mounting bracket. My plan is to screw the VGA breakout PCB onto this hole and soldier wires to the corresponding pins on the back of the DMS-59 port, and then use female pin headers on the other end of the wire to plug into my PCB. Due to long shipping times from China, I have not recieved this board and tested it yet.</p>

<p>Having sucessfully created my first PCB I thought I may as well make another for a future project, since they were going to take around a month to arrive anyways. I have a future project in mind where I would like to use a low pin count microcontroller and program it in bare-metal C, so I decided to make a development board for the ATTiny 414. The ATTiny 414 was perfect for this project because it was a small, cheap, low power microcontroller with an Analog Comparator, SPI hardware, and it can be programmed with a simple UDPI programmer. The main focus of this project was to get this chip on a development board so I could have access to all the pins, and program and power it with a USB cable.</p>
<p>When looking for a USB to UDPI converter I stumbled across a really interesting project called <a href="https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi">pyudpi</a> which looked like the best solution. It uses a python utility to drive a USB to UART converter IC in such a way that it generates a UDPI signal, only adding an additional 1k ohm resistor to the circuitry. This is what allowed me to add the programmer into the board instead of relying on a bulky, expensive external UDPI programmer.</p>

<p>I followed the reccomendations on the datasheet for the CH340N USB to UART chip I used, and added decoupling capacitors as it recomended. I calculated I needed a 360 ohm resistor for the blue LED I was using based on its data sheet, and an equation I found for calculating the required resistor value for a an LED: <code>(circuit voltage - LED voltage) / LED amperage</code>. Finally I found a guide for how to conenct the USB C port I had used to configure it for USB 2.0 mode for my project, and included a header to connect pin PA0 to the programmer only if a jumper was placed over a pin header. Routing the PCB was difficult due to the closely packed pins in the USB C header, but with a bit of creative routing I was able to make this PCB single sided.</p>
