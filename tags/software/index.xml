      <title>CPU Architecture changes</title>

      <description>During my winter quarter last year I took a class on the RISC-V architecture and learned about the concept of pseudo-instructions, essentially assembler macros that expand to multiple machine code isntructions that do one thing. I was inspired by this idea to implement it in my emulator and assembler since it would fix one of the main things I was unhappy with in the current design: the microsteps. The architecture previously had 32 microsteps which were completely unnecessary except for 2 instructions that used a few extra steps for stack operations.</description>

      <title>MicroPython Macropad Firmware Post Mortem</title>

      <description>While writing the macropad firmware in CircuitPython I ran into some of its limitations, especially in regards to speed and IO. While trying to find solutions I discovered that there was another embedded python project: MicroPython. A basic display test showed that MicroPython was significantly faster than CircuitPython when driving the I2C OLED on the macropad, as well as handling the logic when a key is released. The only problem with MicroPython was that it didn&amp;rsquo;t have a USB HID library to implement the core functionality of the macropad.</description>

Link to a demo
Back in 2021 I discovered the Chip 8 instruction set from a video on youtube of someone writing their own interpreter for it. It looked like a really cool project to spend some on my extra quarantine freetime on, so I went to the technical reference they used and started to work on my own interpreter.
Chip 8 is a great first introduction to computer systems and architecture, especially if you go down the route of writing your own interpreter.</description>

After watching videos by Ben Eater and SLU-4 on their custom 8-bit CPUs implemented in 7400 series TTL logic chips, I became interested in CPU architecture design and decided to make my own. I started with designing the architecture and instruction set, and I set the following goals in mind:
 The hardware should be as simple as possible It must be achievable with TTL Logic gates It should have stack/subroutine operations  My first revision of this architecture was a 16 bit design using a full 16 bit data bus, a write only memory offset register to hack in a virtual address space, and a similarly hacky interrupt system.</description>

      <title>Macropad Firmware V1.0</title>

After working on the firmware for a while, I have got the macropad to work! Progress was pretty quick getting the lighting to work on the board. I had all the neopixels responding to keypresses according to the kdl config file after less than a week of work, and it was really motivating to see the description language I hacked together actually work surprisingly well.</description>
