      <description>From my highschool&amp;rsquo;s maker club I got an old ATI Radeon HD3450 GPU from broken school computers that were being salvaged for their power supplies. I wanted to learn how the graphics card worked electrically, and try modifying it to understand the power delivery circuity worked. Sadly I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to try modifying the circuit the time because this HD3450 only has an S-Video port and a DMS-59 port to output video, neither of which I have a cable for.</description>

After working on the firmware for a while, I have got the macropad to work! Progress was pretty quick getting the lighting to work on the board. I had all the neopixels responding to keypresses according to the kdl config file after less than a week of work, and it was really motivating to see the description language I hacked together actually work suprisingly well.</description>

Three or four months ago, my friend (Varun Sreedharan) approached me about writing firmware for a macropad he has created. It uses a custom PCB, a Raspberry Pi PICO, low profile switches, an oled I2C display, and a few 3D printed parts to create a suprisingly satisfying to use piece of hardware.
I started by writing an parser for a language I named Keyboard Description Language, or KDL.</description>
